        <p>FIFA, also known as FIFA Football and soon to be known as EA Sports FC from 2023, is a series of association football
        video games developed and released annually by <abbr title="Electronic Arts"> <a href="https://www.ea.com   ">EA</a></abbr>. As of 2011, the FIFA franchise
        has been localised into 18 languages and available in 51 countries. Listed in Guinness World Records as the best-selling
        sports video game franchise in the world, the FIFA series has sold over 111 million copies as of 2021. On 10 May
        2022, it was announced that EA and FIFA's partnership of 30 years would come to an end from 12 July 2023 onwards; the
        series will be retitled EA Sports FC. FIFA intends to enter a partnership with a new developer to produce "the real
        game that has the FIFA name".Football video games such as Tehkan World Cup, Sensible Soccer, Kick Off and Match Day had been developed since the late1980s, and were already competitive in the games market when EA Sports announced a football game as the next addition to
        their EA Sports label. When the series began with FIFA International Soccer on the Sega Mega Drive in late 1993, it was
        notable for being the first to have an official license from FIFA, the world governing body of football. The main series
        has been complemented by additional installments based on single major tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA
        Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA European Football Championship, as well as a series of football management
        titles. Since the 1990s, the franchise's main competitor has been Konami's PES series</p>

        <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by <a href="https://account.mojang.com">Mojang Studios</a>. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the
        Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before
        being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development.
        Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238
        million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021.
        
        In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover
        and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and simple machines. Depending on
        their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in
        the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and
        maintain health) and a creative mode (where players have unlimited resources and access to flight). There is also a wide
        variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new
        game mechanics and possibilities.</p>

        <p>Now how can we do a website about videogames without the legendary CS:GO. CS:GO is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/">Valve</a> and
        Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global
        Offensive was released for: Windows, macOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014. Valve
        still regularly updates the game, both with smaller balancing patches and larger content additions.
        
        The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes.
        The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or
        Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine official game modes,
        all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows
        players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition to community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A
        battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was introduced in late 2018.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home">Fortnite</a></h2>
        <img src="img/Fortnite_F_lettermark_logo.png" alt="Fortnite logo">
        <p>Fortnite is an online video game developed by <a href="https://store.epicgames.com">Epic Games</a> and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game
        mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play
        battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a
        cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures
        and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given
        complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas.
        
        Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December
        6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in
        particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less than
        a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross revenue up
        until December 2019.</p>
